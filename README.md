Fork of the Jitsi meet electron client to re-enable remote control. Do not use this unless you understand the risk behind it. Download from the releases section.

Note that I know nothing about the remote control system in Jitsi, and can probably not fix any bugs in it.

This fork will be updated periodically from upstream. It will not always be based off of a commit that was released, mind you, so the latest release *here* might not be the same as the latest release *there*, even aside from the direct modifications of this fork.
