Fork of the Jitsi meet electron client to re-enable remote control. Do not use this unless you understand the risk behind it and the reasons it was disabled. Download from the releases section.

This fork will be updated periodically from upstream. It will not always be based off of a commit that was released, mind you, so the latest release *here* might not be the same as the latest release *there*, even aside from the direct modifications of this fork.

These binaries have not been tested on Windows and Linux, as I only use them on macOS, but I see no reason they would have problems as the only important change was one line of code (which is the same change for all platforms).

Please do not pester the Jitsi team if you have problems related to this fork that don't occur on their client.

Note that I know nothing about the remote control system in Jitsi, and can probably not fix any bugs in it. Whether or not they plan on continuing to do so while it's disabled, I do not know, and you'd have to ask them.
